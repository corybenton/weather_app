weather search for a 5 day forecast
## Name
Weather Dashboard

## Description
The site waits for a city to be entered.  It will then show the current weather and the weather 24 hours from then and so on for 5 days.  It shows the temperature, wind, humidity and a picture for the clouds.  It is sunny if the cloud percentage is less than 20%, cloudy if the cloud percentage is greater than 70%, and partly cloudy otherwise.  The dashboard will show you what country the city is in but not what state.

## Installation
